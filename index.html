    <h1><span class="name-highlight">MD JAHIRUL ISLAM</span> PORTFOLIO</h1>
    <h3>World-class professional web developer</h3>
    <p>Well, my full name is Md. Jahirul Islam Sujon
        First, I started learning web development to build my own website. I never intend to make it as my profession but after few months I was loving it. So it's become my Passion and then I was getting small job offers, so I join few freelancing marketplace, like oDesk, Elance (Now UpWork). This is how it's become my profession. First I was only working with WordPress then besides this, I learn web language like HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript. Also, start learning about hacking and web security once my beloved website got hacked. Learned SEO for internet marketing and now I sell these skills for the living! 
        Beside my professional virtual life, I love travelling, listening music, spending time with family and having party with friends.</p>
